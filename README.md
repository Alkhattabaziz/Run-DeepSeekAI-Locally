# Run DeepSeek AI Models Locally
This‚Äôs an easy demonstration of how to run the new DeepSeek AI models locally. With the use of Ollama, aka large language model, which allows us to run AI models on our local machines.

Then followed it up with the installation of Open WebUI for a nice user interface which will make it similar to ChatGPT.

<br /><br />
<h2>STEP 1: Ollama Installation</h2>
Go to https://ollama.com/download and choose the suitable operating system. Here I chose Linux.

Copy the command then post it on the terminal to run it.

<h2>STEP 2: DeepSeek Installation </h2>
Go back to https://ollama.com/ and choose ‚ÄúModels‚Äù from the top left of the page. Then choose deepseek-r1 from the list shown.

Here, choosing the model size will depend on the computing power of the your machine. I chose 1.5b to make sure my machine can handle it.

Copy the command next to the model of your choice then run it in the terminal.

(Lower size means robust responses but limited)

<h2>STEP 3: Open WebUI Installation</h2>
Before starting the installation of Open WebUI, we need to install Docker; https://www.docker.com/  as a base to run Open WebUI. After finishing downloading and installing Docker, open it and keep it running on the background. *no need to creat an account*

Now it‚Äôs time to have a nicer UI to work with DeepSeek. We can install Open WebUI from their website: https://docs.openwebui.com/  

Then copy the first command and paste it on the terminal and run it. After that, open Docker and you will see a container with a port number which allows to open a web tab inside a browser offline.

Click on the port which will open the webpage and then you‚Äôll need to sign up to be able to use the Open WebUI



<br /><br />
<h2>STEP 4: Enjoy! üòä </h2>
Voil√†, now you can use free and open source AI tool privately without giving your data to 3d party companies.

Note that you can download more models and navigate between them from the drop-down list top left.

1- Go to https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1

2- choose the new model then copy the related command

3- run it in the terminal

3- Refresh the webpage, then choose the new model
